# visualize
# Write a function that prints out "hello"
# Write a function that takes in 2 strings and prints each
# Write a function that takes in 2 strings and loops through each letter of the first string and prints each out
# Write a function that takes in 2 strings and loops through each letter of the first string, then compares each letter from the loop to each letter in the second string (print "MATCH!" if they match)
